# About Me

Hello, my name is Ayden Salazar and I'm a senior studying Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I have a passion for finding data-driven solutions to real-world problems, especially in the context of public health and epidemiology. When I'm not geeking out over a Data Science project, you can find me leading runs as president of UC Berkeley's Running Club, making short films with friends, and going on hiking adventures.

I love meeting new people! Feel free to reach out for anything whatsoever at aydensalazar09@gmail.com.
